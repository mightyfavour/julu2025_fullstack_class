content, padding, border, margin
CSS Box Model

Every element in HTML is a rectangular box made up of:

Content → The actual text/image inside.

Padding → Space between content and border.

Border → A line around padding & content.

Margin → Space outside the border, separating elements.

CSS Position

Static → Default; elements appear in normal flow.

Relative → Positioned relative to its normal position.

Absolute → Positioned relative to the nearest positioned 
(non-static) ancestor.

Fixed → Stays in the same place, even when scrolling.

Sticky → Behaves like relative, but "sticks" to the viewport when 
scrolling past.

Float and Clear

float → Pushes an element to the left or right.

clear → Prevents elements from wrapping around floated elements.
